classdef TestCvg  < matlab.mixin.Copyable
    % TestCvg class  monitor convergence criterion during optimization
    %
    % At each iterations of an optimization algorithm (see :class:`Opti` generic class),
    % the :meth:`testConvergence` method of an :class:`TestCvg` object will be executed in order to acheive user
    % defined computations
    %
    % **Example** CvOpti=TestCvg()
    %
    % **Important** The :meth:`testConvergence` method should have an unique imput that is the :class:`Opti` object in order to
    % be generic for all Optimization routines. Hence the update method has access (in reading mode)
    % to all the properties of :class:`Opti` objects.
