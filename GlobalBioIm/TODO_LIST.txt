   - In Map plus_ and minus_ test if equal to itself (or a scaled version of itself) and return the corresponding scaled version of itself. Do the analogy in LinOp and Cost.

   - In Map makeComposition_ test if inverse and return identity (the analogy of makeComposition_ in MapInversion)

    - For LinOpConv if we do H^-1*H we get a LinOpConv and not an identity. In makeComposition_ of LinOpConv test if the new mtf is constant and return the appropriate LinOpDiag. This is more general and holds other LinOps that have a new implementation of mpower_

    - add the possibility to add a scalar to a Map for adding a scaled identity

    - May have some problems in LinOpDico to fix

    - Put OneToMany and StackLinOp properly in the new framework

    - Check things related to RFT

    - improve the makeComposition of LinOpComposition. Suff from LinOpComposition can be moved into MapComposition

    - generic norm computation (with Mikeâ€™s function) ?
